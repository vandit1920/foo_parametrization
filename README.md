# Foo Parameterization Package

This package provides functionality to calculate the Foo et al. parameterization for a sphere. The parameterization takes the radius of a sphere and returns its volume. This package is designed to be a community project and supports easy extension and integration with other projects.

## Installation

To install the package, run this command:
pip install foo_parameterization_vandit

## Calculating Volume
The method calculate_volume computes the volume of the sphere using the formula:
volume = (4/3) * pi * (self.radius ** 3)

pi = 3.14

## To build this package: 
Virtual environment was used and while uploading it on github it was ignored for public. 

## Necessary tools used:
pip install build twine


To build the package: 
python -m build

## To run tests:
python -m unittest discover tests

## Conclusion
This package provides a simple yet extensible way to calculate the volume of a sphere using the Foo et al. parameterization. It is designed to be a community project, allowing for the continuous introduction of new features and improvements by many contributors. The package includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness.
